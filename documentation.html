<h1>Documentation for this AppHub project</h1>

<p>(Open this file in your browser)
There are a lot of files here so this document will try to explain what they all do.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>.html files</h2>

<h3>index.html</h3>

<p>This is the file that is immediately loaded by the browser.</p>

<p>In every .html file, the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> contains all of the .js and .css files needed. </p>

<p>The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>.
 is also common in index.html and appProposal.html. </p>

<p> There is a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> section and the bottom of the file that contains the script to display all of the apps from firebase. This creates a new <code>AppItem</code> (in appItem.js) object and gets the <code>element</code> field from it.</p>



<h3>login.html</h3>

<p>Pretty basic page. It contains all of the .js and .css files</p>

<p>Contains a form that calls <code>logIn()</code> function in buttonFunction.js </p>


<h3>createAccount.html</h3>

<p>Similar to the login page, it calls <code>createAccount()</code> in the buttonFunctions.js </p>


<h3>appProposal.html</h3>

<p>This page includes a form for proposing apps. (Not implemented yet)</p>
<br><br>

<h2>.css files</h2>

<p>This file contains all of the CSS rules for the whole website. It isn't organized well but we can worry about that later.</p>
<br><br>

<h2>.js files</h2>

<h3>firebase.js</h3>

<p>This file includes the Firebase API. <b>DO NOT CHANGE</b> </p>

<h3>session.js</h3>

<p>The idea behind this file is that it basically maintains a user's session on the website. </p>

<p>It contains a function that gets run as soon as the page has loaded (the <code>$(document).ready(function(){</code>. This calls the <code>initializeFirebase()</code> that Firebase gave us. </p>

<p>It also controls the login system. When the page loads, it checks the <code>sessionStorage</code> for a current user. <code>sessionStorage</code> is a data structure provided by the browser using a key (in this case <code>user</code>). If the <code>sessionStorage</code> returns nothing for <code>user</code>, then no one is logged in. It logs this to the console. Otherwise, it sets the <code>activeUser</code> global variable to whatever is in there.</p>

<p>Another thing about the <code>sessionStorage</code>. When a user logs in, the system stores a string of a JSON object. JSON is JavaScript Object Notation</p>

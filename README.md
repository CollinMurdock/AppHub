### Issues:

1. **DONE** Fix all of the errors in console on load
2. **DONE** Fix welcome message on left side of header
3. **DONE** Make it so the user can just press enter to log in instead of clicking the button

### Other TODO:

1. **DONE** Compile all of the js includes into one so there isn't a bunch in the head of every .html file. Also decide what pages need which js files
2. **Done** Get rid of AppItem class. It can be done just with a function. 
3. Make buttons nicer using Pure css

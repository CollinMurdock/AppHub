### Issues:

1. Fix all of the errors in console on load
2. Fix welcome message on left side of header
3. Make it so the user can just press enter to log in instead of clicking the button

### Other TODO:

1. Compile all of the js includes into one so there isn't a bunch in the head of every .html file. Also decide what pages need which js files
2. **Done** Get rid of AppItem class. It can be done just with a function. 
3. Make buttons nicer using Pure css
